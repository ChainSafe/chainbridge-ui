## Install

```
yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file in the root of the project.
Get a Blocknative DAPP ID (here)[https://explorer.blocknative.com/account] and populate the respective field in the `.env` file

## Usage

### Development

For running a local instance use the command:

```
yarn start
```

The codebase is configured to be run against the Geth <> Substrate node that can be set up by following the guide [here](https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/local/) or executing:

- `yarn start:substrate` to start,
- `yarn setup:example` to initialize

Should the substrate chain you are targetting require different type definitions, the type definitions file should be added to `src/Contexts/Adaptors/SubstrateApis/` and the file name for the types set in the substrate bridge configs.

### Build

Update the configs for the bridge in `src/chainbridgeContext.ts`. There should be at least 2 chains configured for correct functioning of the bridge. Each chain accepts the following configuration parameters:

```
export type BridgeConfig = {
  networkId?: number; // The networkId of this chain.
  domainId: number; // The bridge's domainId.
  name: string; // The human readable name of this chain.
  rpcUrl: string; // An RPC URL for this chain.
  type: ChainType; // The type of chain.
  tokens: TokenConfig[]; // An object to configure the tokens (see below)
  nativeTokenSymbol: string; // The native token symbol of this chain.
  decimals: number;
};
```

```
type TokenConfig = {
  address: string; // The address of the ERC20 token
  name?: string; // The name of the ERC20 token. This can be left out if the token implements the ERC20Detailed standard
  symbol?: string; // The symbol of the ERC20 token. This can be left out if the token implements the ERC20Detailed standard
  imageUri?: string; // A URL pointing to the token logo. Can be either locally or externally hosted.
  resourceId: string; // The resourceId to be used when transferring tokens of this type.
  isNativeWrappedToken?: boolean // Flag to indicate that this is a wrapped native token (eg wETH on Ethereum). If this flag is not set for any of the tokens provided for this chain, wrapping functionality will be unavailable on that network.
  decimals?: number;
  isDoubleApproval?: boolean; // The token (eg USDT) will request approval twice to defend from the attack on approve/trasferFrom  methods
};
```

EVM Chains should additionally be configured with the following params

```
export type EvmBridgeConfig = BridgeConfig & {
  bridgeAddress: string;
  erc20HandlerAddress: string;
  type: "Ethereum";
  nativeTokenSymbol: string;
  // This should be the full path to display a tx hash, without the trailing slash, ie. https://etherscan.io/tx
  blockExplorer?: string;
  defaultGasPrice?: number;
  deployedBlockNumber?: number;
};
```

Substrate chains should be configured with the following

```
export type SubstrateBridgeConfig = BridgeConfig & {
  type: "Substrate";
  chainbridgePalletName: string; // The name of the chainbridge palette
  transferPalletName: string; // The name of the pallet that should initiate transfers
  bridgeFeeFunctionName?: string; // The name of the function to fetch the bridge fee
  bridgeFeeValue?: number; // The value of the bridge fee, scaled to human readable amounts. If the `bridgeFeeFunctionName` above is provided the onchain value will take preference.
  transferFunctionName: string; // The name of the method to call to initiate a transfer
  typesFileName: string; // The name of the Substrate types file. The file should be located in `src/Contexts/Adaptors/SubstrateApis`
};
```

Run `yarn build`.

Deploy the contents of the `/build` folder to any static website host (eg. S3, Azure storage) or IPFS.

The project can also be built and deployed to Netlify, Render.com by configuring the Build command and Publish directory on the respective service.
